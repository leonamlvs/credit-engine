# Credit Engine Requirements

## Status

This document is the operational specification for the Credit Engine. Interpretations and explicit
contract decisions are recorded separately in `assumptions.md`. Sequential identifiers are stable
and must not be renumbered when future requirements are added.

## Functional Requirements

### System purpose and rule representation

#### REQ-001 — Credit-engine capabilities

The system must provide a REST API that classifies customers into risk clusters, calculates personalised credit limits, and estimates monthly income.

#### REQ-002 — Data-driven classification rules

The classification engine's business rules must be data-driven and representable as configuration rather than buried in logic.

### Customer input

#### REQ-003 — Customer schema

The customer object must contain the fields and types shown in the project schema:

| Field               | Type     | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                | string   | Unique identifier                                 |
| `name`              | string   | Full name                                         |
| `age`               | integer  | Age in years                                      |
| `score`             | integer  | Credit bureau score                               |
| `has_market_debt`   | boolean  | Whether the customer has any recorded market debt |
| `market_debt_types` | string[] | Active debt types                                 |
| `location.city`     | string   | City of residence                                 |
| `location.state`    | string   | State abbreviation, such as `SP` or `RJ`          |
| `location.region`   | string   | Customer region                                   |
| `job_title`         | string   | Free-text job title                               |

Interpretation: See `ASM-009` for the approved structural interpretation.

#### REQ-004 — Score range

`score` must be within the inclusive range `0–1000`.

#### REQ-005 — Region values

`location.region` must use one of these values:

- `Norte`
- `Nordeste`
- `Centro-Oeste`
- `Sudeste`
- `Sul`

#### REQ-006 — Valid market-debt types

Every value in `market_debt_types` must be one of the five contract values:

| Value            | Meaning                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `credit_card`    | Active credit card (non-defaulted)   |
| `personal_loan`  | Active personal loan (non-defaulted) |
| `mortgage`       | Mortgage (non-defaulted)             |
| `credit_default` | Credit card in collections           |
| `loan_default`   | Loan in collections                  |

### Customer clusters

#### REQ-007 — Cluster evaluation order

Clusters must be evaluated in priority order, and the first cluster whose conditions are fully met must be assigned.

#### REQ-008 — CLUSTER_A

Priority 1 `CLUSTER_A` (`Diamond`) applies when all of these conditions are met:

- `score >= 700`;
- `25 <= age <= 60`;
- `has_market_debt == false`.

Its base limit is `R$ 50,000` and its cap is `R$ 100,000`.

Interpretation: See `ASM-003` for the inclusive-age interpretation.

#### REQ-009 — CLUSTER_B

Priority 2 `CLUSTER_B` (`Gold`) applies when all of these conditions are met:

- `score >= 500`;
- `18 <= age <= 65`;
- neither `credit_default` nor `loan_default` is present in `market_debt_types`.

Its base limit is `R$ 20,000` and its cap is `R$ 40,000`.

Interpretation: See `ASM-003` for the inclusive-age interpretation.

#### REQ-010 — CLUSTER_C

Priority 3 `CLUSTER_C` (`Silver`) applies when `score >= 300`. It has no age or debt condition. Its base limit is `R$ 5,000` and its cap is `R$ 10,000`.

#### REQ-011 — CLUSTER_D

Priority 4 `CLUSTER_D` (`Bronze`) is the catch-all cluster. Its base limit and cap are both `R$ 0`, and the customer is denied with `approved = false`.

### Job-title categories

#### REQ-012 — Case-insensitive substring matching

Job-title keywords must be matched case-insensitively anywhere in the free-text `job_title`.

#### REQ-013 — Job-category evaluation order

Job categories must be evaluated top-down in priority order, and the first matching category must win.

#### REQ-014 — EXECUTIVE category

Priority 1 `EXECUTIVE` has multiplier `2.0` and these keywords, in the configured terminology and order:

`CEO`, `CFO`, `CTO`, `COO`, `CIO`, `CMO`, `Chief`, `President`, `Vice President`, `VP`, `Director`.

#### REQ-015 — SENIOR_PROFESSIONAL category

Priority 2 `SENIOR_PROFESSIONAL` has multiplier `1.5` and these keywords:

`Senior`, `Lead`, `Manager`, `Coordinator`, `Supervisor`, `Principal`.

Priority 3 `MID_PROFESSIONAL` has multiplier `1.0` and these keywords:

`Engineer`, `Analyst`, `Developer`, `Specialist`, `Designer`, `Accountant`, `Consultant`, `Architect`.

#### REQ-017 — JUNIOR_PROFESSIONAL category

Priority 4 `JUNIOR_PROFESSIONAL` has multiplier `0.7` and these keywords:

`Junior`, `Trainee`, `Intern`, `Apprentice`, `Assistant`, `Associate`.

#### REQ-018 — OTHER category

Priority 5 `OTHER` has multiplier `0.8` and applies when no keyword from a higher-priority category matches.

### Monthly income

#### REQ-019 — Monthly-income derivation

Monthly income must be derived from the assigned cluster and job category. Values are in BRL.

#### REQ-020 — Monthly-income matrix

The monthly-income lookup must use this exact matrix:

| Cluster     | `EXECUTIVE` | `SENIOR_PROFESSIONAL` | `MID_PROFESSIONAL` | `JUNIOR_PROFESSIONAL` | `OTHER` |
| ----------- | ----------: | --------------------: | -----------------: | --------------------: | ------: |
| `CLUSTER_A` |      30,000 |                20,000 |             12,000 |                 8,000 |  10,000 |
| `CLUSTER_B` |      20,000 |                15,000 |              8,000 |                 5,000 |   6,500 |
| `CLUSTER_C` |      10,000 |                 7,000 |              5,000 |                 3,000 |   4,000 |
| `CLUSTER_D` |           0 |                     0 |                  0 |                     0 |       0 |

### Credit limit and penalties

#### REQ-021 — Credit-limit formula

The approved limit must be calculated in this exact order:

```text
approved_limit = round_to_nearest_100(
  min( base_limit × job_multiplier × penalty_factor, cluster_cap )
)
```

Interpretation: See `ASM-007` for the approved midpoint interpretation.

#### REQ-022 — CLUSTER_D approved limit

`CLUSTER_D` must always yield `approved_limit = 0`.

#### REQ-023 — Penalty position

The penalty must be applied after the job multiplier and before the cluster cap.

#### REQ-024 — DEFAULT_DEBT_PENALTY

Priority 1 `DEFAULT_DEBT_PENALTY` must apply an effect of `×0.5` when `credit_default` or `loan_default` is present in `market_debt_types`.

Interpretation: See `ASM-006` for the single-trigger interpretation.

### HTTP contract

#### REQ-025 — Classification endpoint

`POST /customers/classify` must accept a customer object in the request body and classify it.

#### REQ-026 — Enriched response

The endpoint must return the same customer object enriched with all calculated fields from the output contract.

Contract: See `ASM-002` for the accepted public response contract.

#### REQ-027 — Stateless operation

The application must be stateless, and nothing may be persisted between calls.

## Testing Requirements

#### REQ-028 — Unit and integration tests

Both unit and integration tests are required.

#### REQ-029 — Unit tests for clusters

Unit tests must cover assignment to every cluster, including boundary conditions such as a score exactly at a threshold.

#### REQ-030 — Unit tests for job categories

Unit tests must cover job-category matching, including case-insensitivity and priority ordering.

#### REQ-031 — Unit tests for credit limits

Unit tests must cover the base formula, penalty application, cap enforcement, and `round_to_nearest_100`.

#### REQ-032 — Unit tests for monthly income

Unit tests must cover the monthly-income lookup for every cluster × job-category combination.

#### REQ-033 — Unit test for denial

Unit tests must cover `CLUSTER_D` denial with `approved = false` and `approved_limit = 0`.

#### REQ-034 — Valid-request integration test

Integration tests must exercise the full request/response cycle and verify that `POST /customers/classify` with valid input returns the correct output contract.

Contract: See `ASM-002` for the accepted public response contract.

#### REQ-035 — Invalid-request integration tests

Integration tests must verify that `POST /customers/classify` with invalid or missing fields returns appropriate error responses.

Contract: See `ASM-008` for the accepted HTTP error contract.

#### REQ-036 — Representative integration scenarios

Integration tests must exercise every cluster through the real HTTP stack and verify each complete
response against repository-owned expected values.

Contract: See `ASM-001` for the repository-owned scenario policy.

#### REQ-037 — Single-command test execution

The test suite must be runnable with a single command.

## Delivery and Documentation Requirements

#### REQ-038 — AI-journey directory

The repository must include an `ai-journey/` directory documenting the AI-assisted process.

`ai-journey/README.md` must briefly summarize which AI tools were used and for what purpose.

#### REQ-040 — Key prompts and iteration

`ai-journey/prompts.md` must document key prompts, what they produced, and how the result was iterated, focusing on interesting interactions rather than a full log.

#### REQ-041 — AI learnings

`ai-journey/learnings.md` must honestly reflect on what worked, what did not work, and what would be done differently.

#### REQ-042 — Documentation depth and honesty

The AI-journey documentation must have meaningful depth and honesty.
